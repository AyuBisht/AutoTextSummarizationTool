Wastewater management is an important approach to protect water resources and it is defined as the collection, treatment, and reuse of wastewater.
 In wastewater collection network as one of important infrastructures, undesirable performance can lead to different problems. 
 Also, wastewater treatment is a process that depends on different physical and chemical issues and therefore the prediction of factors in wastewater treatment plants is so essential. 
 On the other hand, urban treated wastewater is a proper resource for allocating to various uses such as agriculture and industry, but it has its limitations. 
 Improper use of these resources can lead to environmental and health risks and as a result, social dissatisfaction and sometimes economic problems. 
 To manage various aspects of wastewater such as those mentioned earlier, the appropriate risk-based modeling approaches as well as prediction tools are required. 
 Recently, using of Bayesian networks (BNs) because of its advantages has rapidly increased in water and environment modeling and management with considering different sources of uncertainty.
Wastewater and environmental engineers and decision makers can effectively use this model as a soft computing skill in prediction and risk assessment applications. 
In this chapter the fundamentals of BNs modeling, its applications in wastewater systems management, and some practical conclusions are presented and discussed, respectively. 
This chapter can be helpful as a guideline for academics, professional engineers, operators, and decision makers to enhance the different wastewater management aspects by applying BN modeling.
Decentralized wastewater management (DWM) systems are used most commonly in semi-urban, rural, and remote areas, where installation of a centralized sewer system is not feasible (see Figure 1(d)). 
However, in some areas decentralized systems are used instead of centralized sewers to limit and control the type of development in a given area. 
Decentralized treatment systems present a significant challenge for the design engineer due to the need for high-quality reliable performance in 
light of a number of constraints, including long periods of time between maintenance activities, lack of redundant systems, high variability in flow rate and constituent
concentrations, and site-specific factors. Decentralized systems are an integral component of smart-growth community design initiatives in unsewered areas 
and an element of sustainable development because of the potential for low-impact wastewater management and other advantages presented below. 
Further, due to practical and economic limitations, it is recognized that it is not possible or desirable to install centralized sewers to service all areas 
in the United States. Therefore, DWM systems are necessary for the protection of public health and environment and for the development of long-term strategies for 
the management of water resources. DWM is defined as the collection, treatment, and reuse of wastewater at or near the point of waste generation (Crites and 
Tchobanoglous, 1998). Decentralized facilities may be used for wastewater management from individual homes, clusters of homes, subdivisions, and isolated commercial, 
industrial, and agricultural facilities. The wastewater flow rate, quality, and flow distribution will depend on the types of activities taking place as well as the 
scale of the application. This book chapter describes the evolutionary journey of cities with relevance to hydroinformatics: all the significant steps and advancement 
in technology from the primitive form of urbanization to the conceptualization and creation of modern smart cities. A smart city is characterized by the interaction 
between three conceptual components: technology, people and institutions assessed and developed through six distinct characteristics: economy, people, governance, 
mobility, environment and living. With the growing world population, the amount of clean and fresh water required in cities is increasing. 
Although water is part of critical urban infrastructure, many smart cities do not include smart water management in their visions. 
Hydroinformatics is the key link between smart cities and smart water management. It is a science that is not only about modeling and decisions support, 
but it also considers the social dimension of water cycle management, including social needs, concerns, and consequences. 
Hydroinformatics takes full advantage of the proliferation of remotely sensed information from space and ground-based sensors with increased capabilities in terms of
spatial and temporal resolutions generated by the advancements in smart city technologies. Applications of hydroinformatics in the urban environment have increased 
in recent years. Smart cities technologies and infrastructures offer the potential of linking together all the aspects of the urban water cycle and can lead 
to the development of an integrated smart water cycle management.
